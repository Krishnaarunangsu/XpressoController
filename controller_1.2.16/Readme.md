## How to use sample JSONs

This folder contains the sample json files for various operations
provided by xpresso client - **xprctl**.

Before using these json files, please make sure you have gone  through the [Controller Reference](https://abzooba.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/XS/pages/720273420/Xpresso.ai+Controller+Reference), [Developer Guide Documentation](https://abzooba.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/XS/pages/827392001/Developer+Guide) and [Tutorials](https://abzooba.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/XS/pages/832111107/Tutorials).

Few points to note:

- These json simply provides the structure of the json. It might not work directly. User will need to replace the value of the keys.
- User must need to update the value of terms within 2 curly braces **{{<term>}}**. These terms must be replaced with appropriate values
